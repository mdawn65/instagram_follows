# Find the Instagram users who you follow, but don't follow you back and haven't requested to
Backstory: Got bored, got petty, decided to find the people who don't follow me back on Instagram.
1) First, you need to request your connections information from Meta. https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920?helpref=about_content
3) Then, run this file and receive the list of people who don't follow you back. And, they haven't requested you either. ☹️
